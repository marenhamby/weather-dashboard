# weather-dashboard

## Description

This activity was my first attempt at using API calls. This page required a large compilation of skills including, button linking, using local storage, if statements, for loops, dynamic creation of items, and more! 

The page returns current weather information and future weather information for the next 5 days of the area entered. The cities entered are added to a list on screen as well as saved to local storage. There are many api calls being made on this page in order to render all page parts.


I struggled some with this assignment. When putting so many pieces together I ran into problems in the small details of the work. I got almost everything functioning, but I ran into problems getting the items from local storage to re-render on page refresh. I'll have to work on that bug more in the future!

Enjoy!
